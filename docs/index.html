<h1>flang</h1>
<p>A simple flow chart programming language</p>
<p>"F" is for flow chart.</p>
<p>"F" is for functional.</p>
<p>"lang" is for programming language.</p>

<h1>Tutorial</h1>
<p>Flang is a functional language, which means it's made of functions. Functions take input(s) and give output(s). Some people call these arguments and return values, respectively. The outputs of functions are sent to inputs of others along arrows. Arrows are navy curves.</p>
<p>Aren't they cute? The computer loves to pick and choose among its babies, so it sends outputs to inputs along arrows in any order it wants, as long as the function is ready with the outputs.</p>
<p>Arrows are NOT functions.</p>
<p>Functions are drawn as something inside a polygon or a lemon shape instead of a 2-gon.</p>
<object data="/icons/default_theme.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
<h3>Start</h3>
<p>It is not a function.</p>
<p>It looks like a "9" with an arrow going out the bottom.</p>
<object data="/icons/start.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
<p>It is where the flow of the program starts. The flow is the places where the computer is reading the program at the moment. You can think of it as a function that will start the program, give a 0, but take nothing. </p>
<p>By itself, it is a complete program. If you run it, the program will do nothing.</p>
<p>The smallest program has the same effect and is composed of nothing, nothing, and more nothing.</p>
<h3>Print</h3>
<p>Assume every heading is for a function.</p>
<p>It takes a value, prints it to the console (terminal), and gives it back.</p>
<h3>Constant</h3>
<p>A constant is a box with a value in it.</p>
<h6>picture</h6>
<p>When a constant takes an input, it gives its value as output.</p>
<h4>First Program</h4>
<p>Now, we have enough knowledge to make "Hello world!" programs.</p>
<p>One looks like this: </p>
<object data="/icons/hello-world.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
<h6>picture using a start, then 11 constant/print pairs</h6>
<p>but the letters would be out of order.</p>
<h3>Keyboard</h3>
<p>When a keyboard takes an input, it gives a value from the console (terminal) as output.</p>
<h6>picture</h6>
<h4>Second Program</h4>
<p>Take five characters, printing each.</p>
<h6>picture</h6>
<h3>Left</h3>
<p>Left takes two inputs and outputs the left one.</p>
<h6>picture</h6>
<h4>Program</h4>
<h3>Equality</h3>
<p>Equality takes three inputs, one on the top left, one on the top middle and the last on the top right.</p>
<p>It gives two outputs, one on the bottom left, and the other on the bottom right.</p>
<p>Once it takes all inputs, if the outermost are equal, it will output the middle input on the bottom left; if they are not equal, it will output the middle input on the bottom left.</p>
<h6>picture</h6>
<h4>Third Program</h4>
<p>If z is inputted, say ":)"</p>
<p>Otherwise, say ":("</p>
<h6>picture</h6>
<h3>Sum</h3>
<p>It gives the sum of its two inputs as an output.</p>
<h6>picture</h6>
<h4>Fourth Program</h4>
<p>Output the sum of two and three.</p>
<h6>picture</h6>
<h3>Difference</h3>
<p>It gives left input - right input as an output.</p>
<h6>picture</h6>
<h3>Multiplication and Division carry the pattern.</h3>
<h3>Greater than (>)</h3>
<p>It gives the middle input if left input > right input on the left output.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it gives the middle input on the right output.</p>
<h6>picture</h6>
<h4>Fifth Program</h4>
<p>Determine if the input is greater than f.</p>
<h6>picture</h6>
<h3>Function</h3>
<p>You can create custom functions in flang. They need to have their own name, number of inputs and outputs, and logic.</p>
<p>They look like this.</p>
<h6>picture</h6>
<h4>Sixth Program</h4>
<p>Print the letter "q" sixteen times.</p>
<h6>picture</h6>
<h3>Bus</h3>
<p>Busses are not functions.</p>
<p>They are a group of arrows, all going in the same direction.</p>
<p>They walk side-by-side, going at the same pace.</p>
<p>They are usually much neater than having an arbitrary number of arrows.</p>
<h3>Push</h3>
<p>Push has two inputs; the left takes a bus and the right takes a value (arrow).</p>
<p>It has one output: the group on the left with the arrow on the right attatched to the right side.</p>
<h6>picture</h6>
<h6>example</h6>
<h6>example</h6>
<h3>Pop</h3>
<p>Pop takes a bus.</p>
<p>It gives that bus without its rightmost member on the left output, and that rightmost member on the right output.</p>
<h6>picture</h6>
<h6>example</h6>
<h3>Rotate Left</h3>
<p>The leftmost member will walk over to become the rightmost member.</p>
<h6>picture</h6>
<p>To get the leftmost member of a bus, rotate left then pop.</p>
<h3>Rotate Right</h3>
<p>The rightmost member will walk over to become the leftmost member.</p>
<h6>picture</h6>
<h3>Length</h3>
<p>It will output the number of arrows in the inputted bus.</p>

<h2>Language Features</h2>
<h3>You can include C libraries.</h3>
<h3>Typelessness</h3>
<p>An "a" is the same as a 97.</p>
<p>If you want to get a number in its text form, add it to the character for 0 ('0')</p>
<p>For the converse, subtract.</p>
<h3>Busses</h3>
<p>If you want to have many characters in a bus from constants, you can use double quotes, and the constant will output a bus of the characters in the quotes.</p>
<h6>picture</h6>
<p>If you want a bus of numbers, separate them by commas.</p>
<h3>Nothing is tacked down.</h3>
<p>Normies will flip out since there aren't variables, much less types or objects.</p>
<h3>Easy to visualize.</h3>
